## Example program

```python
# import module
import pyttsx3
engine = pyttsx3.init()
engine.say('Hello welcome to speech synthesis in Python programming language.')
engine.say('I am Moralist Festus.')
engine.runAndWait()
```
This simple program `simple.py` will convert the text to speech.

```python
import pyttsx3
engine = pyttsx3.init() # object creation

""" RATE"""
rate = engine.getProperty('rate')   # getting details of current speaking rate
print (rate)                        #printing current voice rate
engine.setProperty('rate', 125)     # setting up new voice rate


"""VOLUME"""
volume = engine.getProperty('volume')   #getting to know current volume level (min=0 and max=1)
print (volume)                          #printing current volume level
engine.setProperty('volume',1.0)    # setting up volume level  between 0 and 1

"""VOICE"""
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')       #getting details of current voice
#engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)  #changing index, changes voices. o for male
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)   #changing index, changes voices. 1 for female

engine.say("Hello World!")
engine.say('My current speaking rate is ' + str(rate))
engine.runAndWait()
engine.stop()

"""Saving Voice to a file"""
# On linux make sure that 'espeak' and 'ffmpeg' are installed
engine.save_to_file('Hello World', 'test.mp3')
engine.runAndWait()
```
This program will set voice index, speech rate and save the program to an mp3 file.
